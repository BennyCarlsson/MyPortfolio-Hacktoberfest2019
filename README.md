# MyPortfolio-Hacktoberfest2019 [Live Website](https://bennycarlsson.github.io/MyPortfolio-Hacktoberfest2019/)

Help me make a horrible portfolio by letting people from all over the world contribute with their own ideas and design!

If you have any questions or any requests, feel free to message me!
By the way, following articles and tutorials will guide you to create complete and correct pull requests.

_Disclaimer! This is a project for fun! I do not expect a professional or high standard website for free. I expect the community to give me a horrendous portfolio and that we will have fun creating it together_

## Contribution Rules (Will be updated)

### Don't

- No spam! Small contributions like minor styling or spell correction are accepted but obvious spam for the t-shirt will be labeled invalid.
- Don't use prettier/auto indent/ auto format because it will create HUGE merge conflicts
- Do NOT add any build steps e.g. npm install (I want to keep this a simple static site).

### Do

- Keep pull requests small to minimize merge conflicts.
- Make sure there is no merge conflict
- Fun things! This is not supposed to be serious or pretty. Be creative add easter eggs and pink stuff! üê∑
